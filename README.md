🦖 READ AND WRITE REPORT (RAWR) Agent 🦖
an Nvidia AIQ Workflow template by Jeremy K

Uses the Nvidia AIQ toolkit to ask an LLM to review an image from the internet url or a local file, and extract the json data out of it using a prompt of your choosing. Another tool writes a custom report from json, using the Report Creator template engine by Daren Ace, displaying the data in a single file html readable format.

The function calling and image data extraction uses an LLM from build.nvidia.com, but can also be setup to use other providers like OpenAI.

You can have multiple templates for different types of reports, accessable from one function call parameter. You can easily create visually appealing html reports with Report Creator, that are generated from scripts in the report_templates folder.

This is a starter workflow, for you to build your own RAWR Agent using Nvidia AIQ, customized for your requirements. This template starts your agent with the basics for reading images with an llm, and writing a report. Whatever you logic you'd like to put in between is yours to discover.

🦕 GETTING STARTED 🦕

a. Install AIQToolkit - https://docs.nvidia.com/aiqtoolkit/latest/quick-start/installing.html

b. Download this aiq workflow template into a directory in the toolkit (create one called workflows)

c. Pip install the toolkit with AIQ :     uv pip install -e workflows/rawr_agent

d. Start the AIQ RAWR_Agent workflow server in a command window:      aiq serve --config_file configs/config.yml

e. Start the AIQ UI Server in a seperate command window: https://docs.nvidia.com/aiqtoolkit/latest/quick-start/launching-ui.html#launch-the-aiq-toolkit-user-interface

f. Open a browser to http://localhost:3000/ and test chatting with UI. Monitor the command windows for errors for debugging.

g. go rawr in the jungle by testing your own use case

The exported reports are saved in the report_exports folder in the Report Creator self-contained interactive html file format. To view them, open the html file locally in your browser.
